<h1>Items.js ReadMe</h1>


<h2>Overview </h2>

<details>

The **Items.js** file defines an array named items, which contains objects representing various projects in this portfolio. Each project object includes information such as the project name, categories, images, project details, bonus images for popups, and an onClick function triggering a popup.


<H2>Usage </h2> 
The items array is designed to be imported and used in components, particularly with the **MultiFilters component**. Here's an example of how you can import and use it:

```` 
import { items } from "../ components /Items"; 
// Use the 'items' array within your component 
const YourComponent = () => { // ... }; 
export default YourComponent; 

```` 

<h2>Project Objects </h2> 
Each project object in the items array follows a similar structure:

-	**name**: The name of the project.
-	**categories**: An array of categories to classify the project (e.g., "HTML/CSS", "JavaScript", "Design").
-	**image**: The path to the main image representing the project in a grid.
-	**projectInfo**: A brief description or details about the project.
-	**bonusImage**: An array of paths to additional images or multimedia used in popups.
-	**links**: An optional array of links related to the project (e.g., project demos or documentation).
-	**onClick**: A function triggering a popup with the project name.


<h2> Popup Integration </h2> 

The Popup library is used to create popups for additional information about each project. The onClick function of each project triggers a popup using Popup.alert.


<h3> Example </h3> 

```` 
import Popup from 'react-popup'; 
import { items } from "../ components /Items"; 
const PortfolioPage = () => { 
// Use the 'items' array within your component
 Return
 ( <div> <h1>Portfolio</h1> 
 {/* Use MultiFilters or other components as needed */} 
 {/* Render projects, handle onClick to show popups */} {items.map((item, idx) => ( <div key={`project-${idx}`} 

onClick={item.onClick}> 
 
 <img src={item.image} alt={item.name} /> 
 <p>{item.name}</p> </div> ))} </div> ); };
